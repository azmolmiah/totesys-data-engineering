# Overview

## Version Control

Make sure we're all on the same page with version control. We'll use Git and GitHub for this. We'll create a repository to store our project code and collaborate effectively. Each of us will work on feature branches for each new taks and merge changes to the main branch via pull requests this is also called lean branching. For more information checkout [pull requests](pull-requests.md)

## Write Tests

We need to ensure the reliability and quality of our codebase. Let's write comprehensive unit tests using pytest for our Python applications. Additionally, we should include integration tests to validate interactions between different components. Security tests, using tools like `safety` and `bandit` to scan for vulnerabilities, will be handled in the CI/CD GitHub actions to ensure that they are automatically run on each merge to main. For more information checkout [pull requests](testing.md)

## Automate Testing with CI (GitHub Actions)

To automate our testing process, we'll set up continuous integration (CI) using GitHub Actions. We'll create workflows that define the steps to run tests whenever we push changes the main branch or our repository, or merge a pull request. This ensures that our codebase remains secure, healthy and functional. We'll also configure GitHub notifications to alert us of CI workflow results. For details on this checkout [github actions](../.github/workflows/actions.yml)

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

With CI in place, let's focus on continuous deployment (CD). We'll configure our CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy changes to our AWS environment. This includes deploying Python applications to Lambda, updating infrastructure using Terraform, and ensuring proper error handling and rollback mechanisms. or details on this checkout [terrraform](terraform.md)

<!-- Question - do we need a specific branch for production/deployment? -->

## Implement Monitoring and Alerting

Monitoring and alerting are crucial for CI/CD and because we'll be using Github, this will be done for us based on our repository settings.

## Document and Collaborate

As we proceed, let's document our CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure setup. This ensures that all team members have a clear understanding of how everything works. We'll collaborate closely, sharing knowledge and supporting each other throughout the process using Github projects and repository issues tracker.

## Review and Iterate

Finally, let's continuously review and iterate on our CI/CD pipeline. We'll conduct regular retrospectives to identify areas for improvement and optimize our process further. Our goal is to deliver a robust and efficient data engineering solution.

This overview should explain how we'll successfully implement CI/CD for our project, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of changes to our AWS environment. With GitHub Actions and notifications in place, we'll stay informed and responsive to any changes or issues in our workflow.
