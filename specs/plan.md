Here's a structured plan to help you navigate through this project efficiently. We'll break down the project into manageable phases, each with clear objectives and tasks. 

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
#### Objective: Set up the necessary AWS infrastructure and repository structure.
1. **AWS Account Setup**:
   - Ensure all team members have access to the AWS account. &#9745;
   - Create IAM roles and policies with appropriate permissions for S3, Lambda, Cloudwatch, EventBridge, and RDS access. &#9745;

2. **Repository Setup**:
   - Initialize a Git repository for your project.
   - Set up the directory structure to accommodate different components of the project (`ingestion`, `transformation`, `loading`, `infrastructure`, etc.).

3. **Terraform Setup**:
   - Create Terraform scripts to automate the creation of S3 buckets, IAM roles, EventBridge rules, and other necessary infrastructure.
   - Test and apply Terraform scripts to ensure infrastructure is correctly provisioned.

### Phase 2: Data Ingestion
#### Objective: Develop and deploy a data ingestion pipeline to capture data from the Totesys database and store it in an S3 bucket.
1. **Database Connection**:
   - Create a Python script to connect to the Totesys database and fetch data from all required tables.
   - Ensure secure handling of database credentials (use AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables).

2. **Ingestion S3 Bucket**:
   - Set up the S3 bucket structure for ingested data.
   - Define the data format (e.g., CSV, JSON) and partitioning strategy (by date, table name, etc.).

3. **Lambda Function for Ingestion**:
   - Develop a Lambda function to ingest data from the database and write to the ingestion S3 bucket.
   - Implement logging to Cloudwatch and error handling with email alerts.

4. **Scheduling the Ingestion Job**:
   - Use AWS EventBridge to schedule the Lambda function to run at frequent intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes).
   - Ensure the ingestion process meets the 30-minute update requirement.

### Phase 3: Data Transformation
#### Objective: Transform the ingested data into a format suitable for the data warehouse and store it in another S3 bucket.
1. **Transformation Logic**:
   - Develop a Python script to read data from the ingestion S3 bucket, apply necessary transformations, and write to the processed S3 bucket.
   - Ensure transformations align with the target data warehouse schema.

2. **Processed S3 Bucket**:
   - Set up the S3 bucket structure for processed data.
   - Store the transformed data in Parquet format for efficient querying and storage.

3. **Triggering Transformation**:
   - Configure S3 event notifications to trigger the transformation script when new data lands in the ingestion bucket.
   - Implement logging and error handling similar to the ingestion process.

### Phase 4: Data Loading into Warehouse
#### Objective: Load transformed data from S3 into the data warehouse.
1. **Data Warehouse Connection**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary credentials and access to the data warehouse.
   - Create a Python script to connect to the data warehouse and load data from the processed S3 bucket.

2. **Loading Logic**:
   - Implement the logic to load data into the appropriate tables in the data warehouse.
   - Ensure the data warehouse schema is correctly populated and maintains historical data for fact tables.

3. **Scheduling the Loading Job**:
   - Use AWS EventBridge to schedule the loading script at defined intervals.
   - Ensure logging and error handling are in place.

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Alerting
#### Objective: Implement robust monitoring and alerting for all components of the pipeline.
1. **Cloudwatch Metrics and Logs**:
   - Ensure all Lambda functions log to Cloudwatch.
   - Create Cloudwatch dashboards to monitor key metrics such as function execution times, error rates, and data throughput.

2. **Cloudwatch Alarms**:
   - Set up Cloudwatch alarms to trigger email alerts in case of failures or performance issues.

### Phase 6: Quicksight Dashboard
#### Objective: Create a Quicksight dashboard to visualize data from the warehouse.
1. **SQL Queries for Dashboard**:
   - Develop SQL queries to retrieve data from the warehouse for visualization.
   - Ensure the queries align with the business requirements for the dashboard.

2. **Quicksight Setup**:
   - Work with tutors to set up the Quicksight dashboard.
   - Ensure the dashboard effectively displays the required insights.

### Phase 7: Final Touches and Testing
#### Objective: Ensure the entire pipeline is robust, secure, and well-documented.
1. **Code Quality and Security**:
   - Ensure all Python code is PEP8 compliant.
   - Use `safety` and `bandit` to check for security vulnerabilities.

2. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for all Python scripts.
   - Aim for over 90% test coverage.
   - Perform end-to-end testing to ensure data flows correctly through the pipeline.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document all scripts, configurations, and infrastructure.
   - Ensure clear instructions are available for deploying and running the project.

### Phase 8: Presentation Preparation
#### Objective: Prepare to demonstrate the project and its capabilities.
1. **Demo Preparation**:
   - Prepare a demo script to showcase the end-to-end pipeline.
   - Highlight key features such as automation, monitoring, error handling, and the Quicksight dashboard.

2. **Final Review**:
   - Conduct a final review with the team to ensure everything is in place.
   - Make any last-minute adjustments as necessary.
